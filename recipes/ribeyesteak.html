    <h2>Description:</h2>
    <p>
      After eating this style of steak in a restaurant a few times, I worked on
      making my own marinade. The results are tender and do not have an
      overbearing bourbon taste. This marinade is very different from the only
      other one I have seen on this site.
    </p>
    <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>1 cup water</li>
      <li>⅔ cup bourbon whiskey</li>
      <li>½ cup soy sauce</li>
      <li>¼ cup packed brown sugar</li>
      <li>3 tablespoons Worcestershire sauce</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons lemon juice</li>
      <li>4 (6 ounce) beef rib-eye steaks</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Steps:</h4>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Whisk together the water, bourbon whiskey, soy sauce, brown sugar,
        Worcestershire sauce, and lemon juice in a bowl, and pour into a plastic
        zipper bag. Add the rib-eye steaks, coat with the marinade, squeeze out
        excess air, and seal the bag. Marinate in the refrigerator for 8 hours
        or overnight.
      </li>
      <li>
        Preheat an outdoor grill for high heat, and lightly oil the grate.
      </li>
      <li>
        Remove the rib-eye steaks from the marinade, and shake off excess.
        Discard the remaining marinade. Grill the steaks on high, 1 to 2 minutes
        per side, to sear the meat. Move the steaks to a cooler part of the
        grill and cook for an additional 2 to 3 minutes per side, if desired.
